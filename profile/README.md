# Welcome to SDSC-ORDES 🌀
**Deep-Tech Innovation for Data Science Infrastructures**

## Who We Are

We are **ORDES** — a deep-tech prototyping lab at the [Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)](https://datascience.ch).  
Our mission: **turn research ideas into scalable, interoperable digital infrastructures**.  

Founded in 2022, we design and deliver *data science infrastructures* that connect data, code, and governance into *production-ready assets*. Our team blends expertise in semantic interoperability, research software engineering, and data science architecture to build *modular, reusable solutions* across scientific domains.  

We work **with communities**, not just for them — integrating feedback loops between data producers, infrastructure builders, and users to ensure lasting impact and alignment with evolving research needs.  

## Our Focus

We bridge research and infrastructure — making **open, FAIR, and trusted data systems** a practical reality for science and innovation. Join us in shaping the future of data science.
  
Curious? Excited? We invite you to explore our repositories, join the conversation, and contribute to the open movement. 🚀

## 🚀 What We Do

- **Prototype & Experiment** – Rapidly turn concepts into infrastructure-ready MVPs.  
- **Build Reusable Blueprints** – Design modular architectures for scalable RDIs.  
- **Enable Interoperability** – Use semantic standards to connect data and tools across domains.  
- **Embed Governance** – Implement machine-readable policies for FAIR and compliant data access.  
- **Deploy Deep Tech** – Deliver production-grade AI/ML, data pipelines, and integration frameworks.
